# AIROS Swarm GCS

This project aims to develop a Airos Swarm GCS for swarm navigation purposes. The Airos Swarm GCS allows users to define a mission with multiple waypoints, and the swarm navigates through these waypoints while avoiding obstacles and maintaining formation. The project is developed in using Visual Studio and C# as Front End and C++ as Backend.

## Installation

- Clone this repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/airos-software-dev/airos-mission-control.git
```
- Download the Visual Studio Latest version

- Update the necessary sources and plugins installed on the visual studio by using the imports files in the repository.

- Select the AirosSwarmGCS file and build the project

- After the  completion of the build process and a new folder will be created under the name `bin` and the constructed .exe file will be present there.


This will open the GUI interface of the mission planner. You can define a mission by adding multiple waypoints on the map and setting the desired altitude and speed. The swarm will navigate through these waypoints while avoiding obstacles and maintaining formation.


## Features

- Graphical user interface for defining missions.
- Support for multiple drones in a swarm.
- Collision avoidance through obstacle detection and avoidance algorithm.
- Formation maintenance through position control.
- Customizable mission parameters such as altitude, speed, and formation shape.## Contributing
